under_construction
==================

This GEM provides some generators to simplify managing and creating Under Construction
or coming soon page.

features:

* Automatically edits files to redirect all requests to under construction page
* Ability to schedule for removing redirects in a specific launch time
* Save emails in a text file to send newsletters
* Generator for stopping redirects(manual option)
* Including (currently) one free UnderConstruction template

Install
=======

In Rails 3, simply add the GEM to your gemfile:

     gem 'under_construction'

Then run the `config` generator. This will edit your `application_controller` to
redirect all the URLs to under construction page (make a config file before, see `config` section)

    rails g under_construction:config

For removing configs you have to use `clear` generator (After launch time automatically will be run):

    rails g under_construction:clear

Note: the clear generator won't work if you edit the codes generated by `config`,
you need to manually remove them later.

Note: After launch time clear generator will be run.

Config
======

Put your configs in config/under_construction.yml file and edit it as you wish. Depending
on the theme using, not all options may be used:

    theme: 'site-under-construction'
    launch_time: "24 Feb 2050 7:00pm"
    progress: "60" # Percent
    progress_label: "Progress"

Themes
======
There are two themes for under construction but you can design another one and send it for us
or you can modify theme in your views/under_construction/*theme*.

Currently two themes are:

* site-under-construction
* site-under-construction-fa

Assets
======
Every theme has its own asset. First make two directive files in your assets app:

    /assets/javascripts/under_construction.js
    /assets/stylesheets/under_construction.css

In stylesheet, you have to include under_construction/*theme* like below:

    /*
      *= require under_construction/site-under-construction
    */

In javascript, you have to include under_construction/*theme* like below:

    //= require under_construction/site-under-construction

Note: If you want your under construction works on production mode you must adds
under_construction.js and under_construction.css in your production env in
config.assets.precompile like below:

    config.assets.precompile += %w( under_construction.js under_construction.css )

I18n
====
This gem is using standard Rails I18n translation for the error message generated and name of models.

    en:
      email_storage:
        form:
          submit: "SUBMIT"
      controllers:
        under_construction_email_storage:
          create:
            flash:
              success: "Your email added successfully."
      activemodel:
        errors:
          models:
            under_construction_email_storage:
              attributes:
                email:
                  format: "format is invalid"
                  uniqueness: "is registered before"
        models:
          under_construction_email_storage: "Under Construction Email Storage"
        attributes:
          under_construction_email_storage:
            email: "Email"

Send notifications
==================

Email of those who have submited their email in the under construction page will be saved in a simple text file under `db/under_construction_mails.txt`. There's a rake task that automatically reads the file and sends notification mails:

    rake under_construction:send_mails

Note: After launch time, it will be run by scheduler.
